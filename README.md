# BluetoothAuthorize
Python demonstration using Python3 and PyBluez that uses multiple bluetooth signals to authorize users

TODO::
- Threads in Python to run the authLoop for continuous checking of BT addresses while giving access to another set of controls
- Change the authLoop to ping specific BT addresses rather than rebuilding a local devices array and double looping on that array
