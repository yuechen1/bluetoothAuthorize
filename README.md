# BluetoothAuthorize
Python demonstration that uses multiple bluetooth signals to authorize users

NOTE: The Example (using PyBluez) might not be what we end up using, as there is native bluetooth support in Python3
NOTE: I'm trying to get a GUI working for this program in tkinter for Python3, the example in bta.py uses Python2 

Input into how to do the above would be much appreciated
